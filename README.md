# Route Optimization: Shortest Path Analysis in Aviation Networks (In Progress)

## Project Overview

This repository implements a mathematical optimization approach to determine the most efficient routes within a global aviation network. While standard navigation often relies on simple heuristics, this project uses Yen's K-Shortest Path algorithm and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to identify and validate optimal flight trajectories based on distance and connectivity constraints.
